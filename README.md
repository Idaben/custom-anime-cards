# custom-anime-cards
. . .
Go to your anki cards, and paste the corresponding text in the corresponding parts, front, back and styling.


You may need to change some of the stuffs in the code since the name of my entry fields might be different from yours.

Here are my field names and there corresponding descriptions

{{Tags}} = the tags of the cards
{{Expression}} = plain sentence
{{Reading}} = sentence with the furigana and pitch accent colorings.
{{Focus}} = the word that I want to learn in the sentence (the i+1 word, the focus morph, whatever you want to call it)
{{Notes}} = The english definition
{{定義}} = the monolingual definition
{{Snapshot}} = the screenshot 
{{Audio}} = the audio file



I use the migaku dictionary addon and the japanese addon, so I get the pitch accent colors thingy. I removed the migaku code from the card, since everybody has their own different pitch accent add-on stuff.



IMPORTANT
If you encounter any bugs or weird display stuffs, I am 100% sure I don't know how to fix that. So yeah. Happy studying!
